## Mondo

Mondo is hybrid web generator built with Typescript created by Made By Mondo to produce high quality digital products.

## Why Mondo?

You've built a blog or personal site with the new greatest stack, the DX is amazing and the site is fast. Fast forward a couple years and
now everyone else has jumped to the next shiny thing. As you scramble to refactor your site, you can't help but think to yourself, "Why am I doing all this work for a landing page?". This is a valid thought, while the new web frameworks are amazing for web applications and certain use-cases, it can cause for most websites to be over-engineered. Mondo aims to be the happy medium between the bleeding-edge and the foundations of the web. It's not a web application framework, it's a website generator.
